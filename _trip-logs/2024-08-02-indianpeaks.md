# Intro
---
This was a spur of the moment trip. Matt reached out to me the day before and asked if I wanted to hop in this hike that he's been wanting to check out. My good bud Evan came along too. Little to no prep needed just a pack, some water, clif bars and a banana. It is not an overly strenuous or long hike; I think the effort to payoff ratio is off the charts. 
<br/><br/>

# The Trail
---
The Fourth of July trailhead is located at 39°59'42"N 105°38'03"W. It is a small lot that was relatively empty when we arrived. We took the Arapaho Pass Trail all the way to the Arapaho Pass.

We began hiking around 7 am. It was still not very light out and chilly, but both of those variables changed quickly as we started up. There was no rush really because we weren't summitting anything just enjoying the hike. There were a notable amount of little streams and babbling brooks to cross. As we hiked, we spotted a female moose as well from a distance. Having a camera was really great because we were able to capture a lot of good stills of the location. I think a lot of shots turned out cool, like the title card of this page or the thumbnail of this triplog. We took turns being the leader paving the way and setting the pace, being in the middle along for the ride, and having the camera snapping shots and lagging behind. 
<br/><br/>
The entire way up to the sort of basin/pass area, I don't know what to call it, was 3.3 miles. After you pass the fourth of july mine, the trail becomes rocky and you get out of the trees. There's a really unique view to the left for the rest of the way up of the valley below. We made good time and once you are up it becomes a really unique landscape: sort of a rocky, flat field surrounded by the mountains around you. You can see that in some of the images. Like I said we were not summitting any of the surrounding mountains which was actually great, because we were high enough to be closer to their peaks, and able to see them from a different perspective. It was very sunny too, which made it all the better. When we got to the pass me and Matt went off to the scrambling bit and Evan sat and made friends with the mosquitos.

# Scrambling

The YDS (Yosemite Decimal System)
<br/><br/>
The YDS is a method used to classify the difficulty of walks, hikes, scrambles, and climbs. It is commonly used in North America to rate the technical difficulty of a route, particularly in rock climbing and scrambling. The system includes:

    Class 1 – Walking on an easy, well-defined trail.

    Class 2 – Simple cross-country hiking with some obstacles like talus or scree.

    Class 3 – Moderate scrambling, requiring handholds for balance but not typically requiring ropes.

    Class 4 – Difficult scrambling with exposure; falls could be serious, and ropes are often used.

    Class 5 – Technical rock climbing requiring specialized equipment and protection.

I feel this is not specific enough when it comes to defining the terrain. There is a lot of room for interpretation using this YDS system. So, I am including the sierra club's (one of the largest and oldest environment organizations in the USA... ALSO founded by the legend John Muir), further refining of the YDS system to give more detail within each class. Each decimal level within a class (e.g., S-3.0, S-3.1, S-3.2) provides more granularity about the difficulty, exposure, and risk involved.
<br/><br/>
*Scrambling ratings taken from sierraclub.org*

#### YDS CLASS 1
Hiking on trails and easy cross-country travel with little risk.
<br/><br/>
- **S-1.0** Hands-in-pockets walking on well-maintained trails from start to finish, with minimal risk aside from mountain weather and the effects of altitude.
- **S-1.1** Hikes predominantly on a mix of maintained and use trails, requiring virtually no route-finding skill. Terrain consists of stable, easy footing with no vegetation or water obstacles, and low to moderate grades.
- **S-1.2** Intermediate to long distances of cross-country travel over terrain with stable footing and low to moderate grades, but may involve extensive vegetation and/or stream crossings requiring backcountry route-finding skills. Risks include navigation errors, stream crossings, weather, and altitude.

#### YDS CLASS 2
Simple scrambling and rough cross-country travel on scree, talus, and boulders, with minimal exposure and low to moderate risk.

- **S-2.0** Modest distances of rough cross-country travel on low-angle scree and talus, with short segments of easy scrambling on moderate-angle, stable terrain. Minimal exposure and occasional use of hands for balance.
- **S-2.1** Intermediate distances of rough cross-country travel on low-angle scree, talus, and boulders, with extensive easy scrambling on moderate-angle terrain. Hands are often used for balance. Some route-finding skill is needed to navigate obstacles and rockfall hazards.
- **S-2.2** Intermediate to longer distances of rough cross-country travel with lengthy stretches of easy-to-medium difficulty scrambling on moderate to fairly steep angle scree, talus, and boulders. Frequent use of hands is required for balance. Good route-finding skills are necessary. Risk of serious injury from falls or hazards is medium to significant.

#### YDS CLASS 3
Moderate scrambling on steep, rocky terrain requiring handholds for upward movement and safety. Beginners may want a belay due to increased exposure and risk of serious injury.

- **S-3.0** Brief, medium-to-hard scrambling on fairly steep, stable rock with medium to high exposure. Hand and footholds are large and easy to find, requiring little climbing experience. Medium to significant risk of serious injury from falls or other hazards.
- **S-3.1** Short to intermediate length, hard scrambling on fairly steep, predominantly stable rock with high exposure. Hands and footholds are numerous and solid. Some climbers may wish to use a rope. Significant risk of serious injury from falls.
- **S-3.2** Extensive, hard scrambling on fairly steep to steep and sometimes unstable rock with high to severe exposure. Holds often need to be tested. Some climbers may desire a rope. Route-finding skill is needed. Helmet may be advisable. Falls pose a high risk of serious injury or death.

#### YDS CLASS 4
Difficult and exposed scrambling on very steep terrain where a rope is often advisable for safety, given the substantial risk of serious injury or death in the event of a fall.

- **S-4.0** Brief, very hard scrambling on extremely steep, stable rock with high exposure. Limited to fewer than 20 feet of extremely steep rock with lots of exposure. Some climbing skills are needed. A rope is useful for belays and descent.
- **S-4.1** Short to intermediate length, very hard scrambling on extremely steep, predominantly stable rock with severe exposure. Covers up to about 50 feet of extremely steep, exposed rock. Holds must be tested. Many climbers will desire a helmet and a rope. A fall poses a high risk of serious injury or death.
- **S-4.2** Extensive, very hard scrambling on extremely steep and sometimes unstable rock with severe exposure. Multiple or sustained segments totaling over 50 feet of very steep, highly exposed rock. Each hold should be tested. Most climbers will desire a helmet and a rope. A fall poses a high risk of serious injury or death.

Now, the reason I included this scale is one, for future scrambling adventures to refer back to it. And two, to apply it to the scramble we did here. I would say the majority of the way from where we left Evan to the outlook area was 2.2 to 3.0. It involved some figuring out climbing, and there were a couple of uneven rocks, but I wouldn't say it was a super technical traverse. Of course, there was the option to up the difficulty by taking a less obvious route through the rocks, which was fun sometimes. I included a picture of the entire rocky route, which you can see what we were going over. Both sides were not so steep as to be instant death, but losing footing and falling would be very dangerous. When we got to the end we sat for around half an hour and made our way back to meet up with Evan.

Pictured above is the traverse. If you zoom in you can see me and Hardo at the end.

# Lake Dorothy

Following scrambling we went to the lake we eyed earlier. Of course, with my love for cold water I was obligated to take a dip. The lake was obviously straight snow melt, but I have been in much colder water. I am always happier when I'm buzzing after a good cold water plunge.

# Thankful

I was appreciative of Matt for reaching out to me and inviting me along on this one. He's a good dude currently at the University of Utah, and Evan at this time is finishing up high school because hes a year younger. It was great company on a great day for a hike. I am constantly reminded of the insane environments Colorado has to offer. I would come back to this area, and perhaps backpack it because I know there is more to the trail and more to see, especially down on the other side of the pass down where Caribou Lake is.
