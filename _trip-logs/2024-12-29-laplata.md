# Intro
---
During my first semester of living in New York City, I had developed a strong case of homesickness-not for my actual house or hometown per say, but for the proximity to nature and the beauty of the mountains. Central Park just does not make the cut. There is no awe of nature and it's grandness in an artificial park with landscaped water features, carefully manicured lawns, and the chosen trees that were lucky enough to be zoned for Central Park and not be obliterated. You are also never alone in the city, at least not more than 100 meters from another human. This was something that was getting to me. I yearned for the real outdoors. It's vastness beckoned me. As I drifted off to sleep I imagined it was on a sleeping pad and that I was wrapped cozily in my bag. Mother Nature pleaded with me to stop ducking her. Her shouts echoed off the NYC skyscrapers, and off the taxis and concrete, and through the subway tunnels. I would daydream I was in the forest, and about the sun, the sky, and fresh air. In short, the city (along with many other factors surrounding school) combined with the lack of nature, was driving me crazy. I couldn't wait to go home. I was just trying to make it through finals and I was living for winter break. Eventually, the time came when I took my last final, said sayonara, packed my bags for winter break, and was going through LaGuardia security set for DIA. 
<br/><br/>
The reason I contextualized this is to emphasize how badly I craved nature. I didn't care there was snow everywhere. I didn't care it was the middle of winter. And when I got home I found that neither did Kade, Owen, and Maxx. In fact, they were feeling similar desires for adventure to my own in their respective lives. So, we formulated a trip for the ages. A real outdoors adventure. Something that would satisfy our cravings for nature and then some. This wasn't some rinky dink car camping in the snow, retreat to your seat warmers at 2am kind of trip. We were outdoorsmen. This was going to be some real shit. The plan was to not just camp in the snow, but to backpack, with snowshoes, and create a snow shelter (NO TENT), then sleep there, wake up the next morning, summit La Plata peak, and then head down the next day. It was ambitious. It was going to be perfect. 
<br/><br/>

# Prep
---
A lot of preparation went into this trip, because I have now learned there is very little room for error on something like this. This was my first intensive winter adventure. If you aren't wearing enough layers, don't consider everything you need, etc., you can put yourself in a dangerous situation. We made a couple runs to various outdoors stores, Cabela's, Boot Barn for some reason, and of course REI. We purchased the necessary food and things we needed, as well as rented the snowshoes for a way too high price from REI. We also held gear checks. Made sure we all had proper sweat wicking base layers, mid layers, and shells... good footwear... poles. My pack was probably the worst laid out because of my large sleeping bag taking up way too much room. Owen or kade were probably the best prepared.

# Snowshoeing Up
---
Snowshoeing is the most cursed and difficult aerobic activity that exists on this planet. There is something so difficult about lifting your feet above powder. It's different than walking normally (obviously). I would equate it sort of to walking in water. You're sort of moving in slow motion, and you always have to be mindfull about the oversized duck feet contraptions that are on your feet. Being my first time, it was a foreign sort of waddle to avoid tripping and to push yourself forward. Having the pack on also sort of shifts your weight unpredictably each step. There was some underestimation on the difficulty of this aspect for sure. 
<br/><br/>
The trail started out fairly well packed from previous snowshoers, but as you go on it becomes a little less helpful. Packed and clear trail areas were inconsistent, and we often were breaking trail ourselves or following a very faint, powder covered trail. All of this was a brutal uphill battle. The distance wasn't long - just 2.4 miles, but the elevation gain was a nutty 4,936ft. The tracks we were following barely had switchbacks (probably because it was from them going downwards), so were charging straight up the mountain. Whoever blazed the trail clearly hated reasonable grades of less than 15%. My calves and quads were getting worked. I will also say, having poles is absolutely necessary, there is no way you can walk with a backpack on your back and stay balanced above the snow without those. 
<br/><br/>
Eventually, we broke through the trees and reached the treeline. La Plata Peak greeted us, wondering what the hell we were doing up there, and ominously hid behind some clouds. It's ridges were dusted with snow, and we could actually make out some day hikers who were attempting a summit. They bailed and we spoke with them a bit. I think they thought we were crazy for sleeping up there. Tucked a bit back in the trees, we found a spot that had some natural shelter and a fallen tree nearby that we could use as part of our camp setup.
<br/><br/>

# Camp
---
We didn't bring a tent. That was part of the challenge. We were going to bring a tent just in case, but for some reason I forgot it or something, I don't remember the details. Less weight I guess. So we got working to create a snow shelter: we dug out to create walls, then used branches and our trekking poles to pitch a tarp over the top like a makeshift roof.

<br/><br/>
The fire - built about 10 feet away from our shelter was so crucial. The only source of warmth especially as it got dark. You did have to be pretty close to it to get warmth. But the smoke that came with it was god awful. I inhaled so much smoke. 
<br/><br/>
Boiling water was a nightmare. This was something we did not consider too much, and should have put more emphasis on preparation before. We only had jetboils, which one do not hold much water to start, and two melting snow is one of the slowest and most inefficient processes known to man. Not only do you need a ton of snow to make a tiny amount of water, but ours kept getting dirty.  Ash from the fire, bits of bark and debris, and general snow gunk was shitty nature seasoning. We were filtering it and still drinking things that probably weren't great for us. We resorted to the (I think self created, yet to be patented) balaclava filtration method. 
<br/><br/>
Meals was another ordeal that evening. Freeze dried food takes forever when you can't get the water hot enough. And eating was done standing or on our pads. We had no chairs, and sitting on the snow without something between means getting soaked and freezing. There was no time really to chill, because of the cold and snow everywhere. This was not a hangout around the campfire in your camp chair and enjoy it as the world around you disappears. This was a survival evening, which is a lot more stressful and less fun. 
<br/><br/>
It was cold. Deep, bone-shivering cold. When you aren't moving, and not near the fire, even layers do not save you. And hands and toes go numb very quickly.
<br/><br/>
Maxx started feeling altitude sickness. There was a quiet guilt of watching a friend suffer while youre just marginally less miserable. 
<br/><br/>
We were all dehydrated, tired, and just barely keeping ourselves going. Then I lost my phone at some point in the trip, I don't know when. It must have fell out of my snow pants pocket into the snow and was gone. I dug for so long that night and the next morning with the snow shovel, turning over every inch I could. It vanished into the white abyss. It had a lot of photos that weren't backed up on it. That was a gut punch - and an expensive one. I think I will go up this summer with a metal detector and try to find it. But yeah La Plata snatched my phone and swallowed it. 
<br/><br/>

# The night
---
As it got later, cute little snowflakes started turning to significant flurries. Then it started snowing. Hard. The snow came down thick and fast. We retreated to our makeshift shelter for the night. Owen on the other hand, stayed by the fire all night with his true grizzly bear mentality. I don't know how he manages to do it. He resorted to questionable tactics for warmth, like sleeping on hot coals, which burned right through his layers, and he had to fetch firewood constantly throughout the night. Somehow though, he kept that fire alive. And even more impressively, he kept himself alive in very subpar conditions. Just like on our lake backpacking trip the past summer. Owen somehow enters a survival mode and becomes one with the elements. Because of the snow, which we estimate was 6-7 inches in the morning, our shelter started to sag under the weight and I woke up to the tarp a couple inches from my face. Much of our gear left out was getting covered. I ended up being able to get half warm, and get some sleep, but it was not quality. The cold crept into my dreams. There was an eerie sort of feeling of being alone up there. The wind whistling and the snow piling up. 
<br/><br/>

# Getting the hell out
---
By morning, we were completely over it. We were frozen, sore, exhausted, and dehydrated. There was no way we were sumitting. Packing up camp with numb fingers was torture. It took way longer than usual - trying to stuff a sleeping bag, collapse the tarp, gather trash. My stiff fingers fumbled with gear and I cursed a lot under my breath. The fire was also dead at this point, and everyone's motivation was lower than the temps. I think this was where I realized no one was there to save me. No one was going to stuff my sleeping bag, or zip up my pack and put in on my back. In that sense, the unforgiving nature of nature became apparent to me in a way I haven't experienced before.
<br/><br/>
Our trail from the day before was completely gone. We couldn't follow our old route and had to use GPS to navigate down. It meant lots of stopping, checking, and guessing. The descent was steep and awkward. Having heavy packs + steep inclines down equaled sort of controlled slides a lot of the way. The sun finally started coming out more, and there was this weird moment of beauty—snow glittering on the branches, our breath visible in golden light, and evil evil La Plata behind us, silent and massive. We didn’t say much. Just moved. There was a quiet kind of respect in the air recognizing we severely underestimated this trip, had learned a lot, and like we knew we’d been through something.
<br/><br/>
Took a couple hours but we made it. 
<br/><br/>

# Aftermath
---
I had to thaw out mentally as much as I did physically. 
<br/><br/>
We hit a gas station, feasted on some ice cream sandwiches. There was a surreal contrast: less than 24 hours I was drinking ash pine needle water, now I could debate on which colorfully flavored gatorade I wanted. 
<br/><br/>
Then we hit a nice pizza spot in Buena Vista. 
<br/><br/>
In the car on the way home, I stared out the window for a long time, replaying the trip in my head. It was rough. It tested me in ways I didn’t expect. But it also gave me clarity. There’s something about surviving something hard—really hard—that resets your brain.
<br/><br/>
I think it makes you grateful. Makes you question your limits. Makes you want to keep pushing. And yeah, it sucked in the moment. A lot. But looking back now, I wouldn’t undo it. It is going to be a while before someone can convince me to lace up the snowshoes again though. 
<br/><br/>

# Things Learned & Closing Thoughts
---
- Nature doesn’t care if you’re tired, cold, or not ready. 
- Melting snow sucks.   Start earlier, maybe dont use a jetboil, make sure youre constantly doing it,and collect clean snow. 
- Dont lose your phone. Put it in a safer pocket. 
- Preparation is the bare minimum. But no matter how prepared you think you are, you will have to figure shit out. 
- Cold tests your willpower in strange ways. Even small tasks—unzipping a bag, tightening a strap—become mental challenges.
- Fire is beautiful. Shoutout cavemen for discovering. 
-  The people matter. We were definitely sufferin' together. In situations like this, the people around you make or break the experience. I wouldn’t have made it solo. We balanced each other, stayed calm, and leaned on different strengths.
- I miss it as time goes on. The misery fades faster than the glory. Even just writing all this, I look back fondly on the trip. The itch returns eventually. 

This trip ended up going different than I expected and I took different things out of it than I had preconcieved. We didn’t even summit like we talked about. We didn’t even make it close. We obviously knew the trip wouldn't be easy, but severely underestimated it's difficulty. A lot of which was out of our control. But the trip ended up being about putting ourselves in a hard place on purpose and seeing how we’d respond. It stripped everything down to the basics: warmth, food, movement, survival. And somewhere in that stripped-down version of life, I found something real that I was craving before in the city. 
<br/><br/>
There were moments I wanted to quit. There were moments I hated it. But there were also moments—brief, quiet ones—where I looked around and felt something close to peace. Or clarity. Or maybe just the simple satisfaction of being exactly where I was, doing something hard with people I trust.
