# Intro
---
The week I spent in Moab and it's surrounding areas is a feeling I've been trying to catch ever since. I decided to create this site months after the trip.  Some more insignificant trips I opted to just let go. But this adventure was so important to me and my life that I had to circle back and writeup the trip. 
<br/><br/>
I didn't even plan on going. It was one of those last minute why not decisions. I showed up a day late, found the group in the City Market grocery store parking lot already sunburned and dusty, toes out. Very glad I made that decision to come.
Once again, because I am writing this nearly a year later, I am not going to try to recount all of the details of the trip, but rather the feelings it evoked and what has stuck with me over time. I write more creatively rather than analytically and historically than other logs.

# The People
---
There were seven of us. Post writing this and as I'm rereading it, it reads like a coming of age story. The ones with "you're probably wondering how I ended up in this situation." The corny movies where in the first 5 minutes it cuts to each of their faces and I voiceover, narrating while they do things in slowmo. But I'm going to keep it because they're all amazing people that I love a lot. 

- Abigail: could be intimidating to some. almost stoic, quiet power to her. keeps it real. great eye for photography. a person you can trust.
- Kade: somehow it seems he has lived a dozen lives already. good at his worklife balance. an honest, hilarious person. always looking ahead. ambitious. he knows what he wants and knows what makes him happy. 
- Katelyn: Warm and smiling. the person i knew the least before but connected with instantly. A kind, deeply in tune, unique, emotion feeling, amazing person. 
- Maxx: one of my closest friends. adventurous, carefree. just gets it. his views on the world and outlook on things are contagious. golden retriever energy. thinks big.  
- Owen: strong and sure in a sort of "i got this" way. capable outdoorsman. knower of many knots. infinite pocket space. Firemaster. this trip sort of reignited our friendship from when we knew eachother in middle school.
 - Sarah: down to earth human. we go way back and knew eachother all of high school. mediocre at spanish. laid back and great sense of humor. 
- me: I brought what I brought. I'll try not to sound too contrived and self important but I believe my friends would write some nice stuff up about me too.
<br/><br/>

What was really cool was watching us all get more comfortable with each other. You can tell when a group crosses that threshold of friends on the surface to real friends. That happened.

# The Utah Desert
---
What an unreal place on earth. So different than any place I've seen. I remember being in arches national park and thinking: how the hell does delicate arch even exist. How did it get to be that way naturally? It's insane really. The unreal arches frame sky with their curves looking as though they’ve been formed by the hands of a giant. This giant, I guess, were actually the patient... very patient, elements. The vastness is overwhelming at first, but it’s in that sense of awe that you begin to understand the true scale of the desert. You can see out for a long ways. The land doesn’t beg for attention, but it demands respect. You feel it in the sacredness that hangs over everything. It’s that feeling that I can't quite describe that fills you with wonder. That can be forgotten or hard to appreciate when it's a hundred degrees out, and the UV is 12. But, at nights it cools down and becomes the perfect temps, and the silence of the desert is so peaceful and you feel that indescribable feeling of awe.

***"Tectonic Breath"*** by Brayden Hill
<br/><br/>
***The desert is an old man that's stopped counting his years. He sits like a grizzled old rancher---leather skin cracked by the sun. His body is a patchwork of red rock and dry earth. His eyes are narrow slits in it's canyon sockets, stuck squinting from his staring contest with the sun. Each breath he takes, a thousand years go by... his diaphragm expanding with tectonic patience. He smells of  sun baked earth and heat and of rust and dirt. We were visitors on his ancient land. We reverently wandered and explored around the twisted juniper trees and sagebrush and up rock faces. He kept his eyes on us with flinty amusement as we scrambled over his arthritic ridges. In his cosmic boredom, his eyes glinted with some joke older than language. Then he exhaled. We had been gone for centuries, lives lived; but we never really shook the dust from our souls.***

# Freedom & Spontaniety
---
With no committments or anything the best moments of the trip were the unplanned ones. We were refueling at the gas station, ready to start the road trip home, when someone I forget who said "what if we just stayed one more day." Literally no one was opposed and after some frantic phone calls to make sure it was ok with everyone back home, we were trying to find camp again. That last campsite and night ended up being the best one of the trip.

<br/><br/>
At some point on the trip it hit me all at once — that I wasn’t thinking about anything. Not school, not my phone, not what time it was or who I was supposed to be. I was just there, sitting barefoot on a warm slab of rock while the sun melted behind the cliffs. My loud mind was so quiet then. I felt freedom. It was a kind of freedom I didn't notice until it was already wrapped around me — slow, silent, total. The sky blazed pink and orange like a lit match catching paper. We grubbed on our freeze dried meals and didn’t talk much. We didn’t need to. Everyone was spread out across the boulders like cats in the sun, each in their own little pocket of peace. For the first time in a long time, I felt like I wasn’t performing anything — not friendship, not happiness, not identity. I was just being, and that was enough. The quiet was deep and kind. The rocks held the warmth of the day, and I held the warmth of that moment.
<br/><br/>
I realized how little I actually need to be happy.

# Broader Thoughts
---
This trip opened my mind. It made me realize some things I wanted in life. It also gave me some of the best memories ever. We laughed so much, did things we’ll probably talk about forever, and it felt like time slowed down in the best way. It was the highlight of my summer.
