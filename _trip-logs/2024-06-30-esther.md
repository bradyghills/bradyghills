# Intro
---
In an top secret, undisclosed location in the mountains of Colorado (don't look at what my images are called), we departed on a backpacking journey that I will never forget. It was a short trip, just spanning from the 29th to the 1st of july. I think it was the perfect amount of time. 
<br/><br/>
# The Way Up
---
This is a short hike, it is in no means a 15+ miler grueling day of backpacking. I'm not even going to say how long the distance actually is. But it took roughly 3 hours, maybe a little over to get there. And it took that long (besides the elevation), because there was something unique about getting to this location: there's no trail. At least we did not find one anywhere after extensive searching. This place is off grid. When talking to somebody about this trip at school, they said that  going off the beaten path was irresponsible and "harmful to the environment." That got me going. One, I am a human being, I should be allowed to walk through whatever forest I want if nobody owns it(the area we are in is public land). Two, it's worth remembering that humans have been navigating this earth for millenia. Our ancestors didn't have paved trails and campgrounds and visitor centers. This guy was from New Jersey. New Jersey. 
<br/><br/>

There being no trail, we relied on GPS to get to the spot. We were pretty blind because we had no idea how long the trek was going to take, or even where we were actually going to set up. We would hike for 30 or so minutes in the direction we believed was correct, and adjusted direction until we arrived. Because there was no trail, the obstacles of the forest became very apparent. Fallen trees become a tiresome hurdle that get old real quick. There were some water crossings, steep rocks where we had to take big detours, and did I mention fallen trees. But none of these obstacles compared to the sheer incline we faced. We generally did not do switchbacks and walked straight up the damn mountain. Grades were nutty. And it's a whole other element to have a backpack on while doing all of this. But, we made it up with minimal issues and this was the greatest view reveal upon destination I have experienced this far in my life. The combination of not knowing how far we were from the spot, and the lake just appearing, was so unexpected. The sudden sheer beauty just made us all gasp. We were giddy. 
<br/><br/>

# A Short Time in Paradise
---
Set up camp in a good location. Right near the water, a little stream, some trees which hammocks were promptly drawn from, and some huge mossy rock. We were tired and there is not much to do when night falls. Not to mention temps drop. So, we had our dinner and got some rest. Camping in the wilderness makes you an early bird. 
<br/><br/>
The next day, June 30, we had the whole forest to ourselves. Not a soul for miles. The most beautiful lake I have ever been to. Owen fished with his gas station fishing rod which he unfortunately lost the hook for. But not before he caught 12 fish. We figured these fish, living in the most pristine untouched lake ever, had never been fooled by an intelligent all knowing (by fish standards) fisherman such as Owen, so they took the bait every time. 
<br/><br/>
We basked in the sun and the liberation it felt to be away from it all. When we were hungry we ate freeze dried chicken alfredo or jambalaya, and when we were thirsty we drank filtered lake water, and when we were bored we talked, or napped, or glued our eyes to the rigid mountaintops looking down on us. In the early afternoon we snacked. And with a new sense of wonder we decided to leave camp and explore. We wandered through the forest as the trees eyed us curiously, the first humans they had seen in years. 
<br/><br/>
I felt like a kid in that forest. My fears of the future were put on hold for a minute. I just walked around, stopped and examined tree bark or pine needles. I watched the clouds (which were changing suspiciously quickly) and I hummed to myself. I think all three of us took something out of that exploration time. I remember my loud mind go silent; I listened to the forest speak. 
<br/><br/>
I also remember finding a little squishy orange mushroom under a rock. Neon orange. There were little intricacies like that everywhere. 
<br/><br/>
We were out for quite a while. As we were out, not far from camp  really, it started to rain. 
<br/><br/>

# The Storm, The Night
---
The clouds changed quick. At first it was fun. We all were back at camp, the rain made the lake look incredible with the ripples of the drops. But it started getting dark quick because the sun was setting. The sky became angry.  And before we knew it we were soaked. Owen's sleeping bag, which he left in his hammock became a 40lb weighted blanket. We first huddled under a tree for some reason, then took cover in the tent. Drenched to the bone. Temperatures dropped into high 30s to low 40s. Of course, this is a bad position to be in. 

It was a long night. We were on a low flat area, where puddles under us began to form. The stream to our left roared and flowed with a sure intensity. Our damp clothes were in a pile in the corner (it's better to have no clothes than wet clothes obviously), and sleeping bags were wet as well. We braced as thunder clapped. Kade had some dry things, and he was not feeling the tent so opted to go outside for our little fort shelter thing we made. I don't really know how his night went. My sleeping bag was mostly dry, so I was able to curl up and maintain some warmth. Owen shivered all night, essentially naked and probably afraid. I drifted off into some mindless unsatisfying sleep. 
<br/><br/>

# The Way Down
---
A little before 5 am, we decided we were getting the hell out. I was lucky to have gotten the most sleep out of anyone, a rich 3-4 hours. Owen shivered his way through the night, conscious at every moment. Kade ended up sleeping outside, mind you while it was absolutely pouring, in our makeshift fort we made for some reason. To this day I have no idea why. It was still dark, but light was coming soon. So we packed up everything, made sure to leave heaven as perfect as we found it. And left 30 or so minutes later. The way down was quick. With sore bent knees and a fierce desire for society's luxuries, we basically ran down the mountain. 
<br/><br/>
When we returned to civilization we feasted on a hearty breakfast. Owen, rightfully, slept the whole ride home.

June 30, 2024 > 
I am caught up in the beauty of it all. Or rather, I am frozen in its perfection. Glass water reflects wise pines, and wiser rock, and yet wiser stone faced mountain tops. I sit, and breathe, and think, and listen to the sounds of the forest. 
<br/><br/>
Intuitively, it all feels connected; I feel connected. I know the connect the dots page for this existence, whatever it is, is more perfect than my view on this regular, wonderful Sunday. 
<br/><br/>
I helplessly try to connect the dots, carefully patterned to explain all of this. There must be infinite dots, an incredible network of explanations I cannot explain, realities I cannot percieve, and reasons for my living that will forever be just out of reach - a cruel mystery. 
<br/><br/>
Inking the lines of understanding, my pen of reason goes dry. My thread is insignificantly snipped by the shears of God. Why are there trees, water, light?... Clouds? Hands? Pens? Hammocks, fire rocks? My squiggles of reason will never string the dots to answer. The solution is hidden behind before my birth and after my death. The solution may be nothing - pure absurdity and chaos. In my lifetime, I can't even make it from dot 1 to 2. Billions have came before me, looking at trees and lakes, breathing the same air and drinking the same water I do now. They have came and went, staring at the sky in the day and the starts at night. And they have came and went. And billions will hopefully come after me, and do the same. I find comfort that everyone is confused, terrified, and in wonder just as I am. No one has cracked the uncomprehensible code of creation. And I am far too dumb, and tired, and dumb to crack it as well. But its not all so bad and scary as I've made not knowing out to be. I'm perfectly content with this beautiful, perfect view. And I'm eternally grateful to be alive, despite not knowing why.

I will be back here some day. Hopefully with my friends, and if not, I will be back alone.
