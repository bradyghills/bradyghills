excerpt: Asking preliminary questions and my first entry. 
---
I preface by saying I do not expect many, if anyone to come accross this site. If you are for some reason using time to read this, this is the first post ever so that's cool. Today's March 28, 2025 and I am writing from New York City, USA in my dorm (carman hall) at Columbia Univerity. In a lack of direction of where to begin, I'm going to ask myself some questions and see where it goes. 

#### Why do I feel the need to write my thoughts down?

I have felt an overwhelming desire to document my thoughts for a while now. In part, it is because I want to feel important and, (more secretly and selfishly) not be forgotten. Not in the sense of fame, but in a way that my existence and my ideas, however trivial, can carry weight in the world. Maybe it's a desire to leave something behind that transcends time. I want people who come after me, especially my kids, to have a glimpse into my mind, to know the way I saw the world, the things I struggled with, the things that I enjoyed, the many, many things that puzzled me, and my growth as a person. I think there's no better time to start documenting all of these things than at age 18. 

I don’t care about the quality of what I write, or whether it’s polished and perfect. Or rather I *should not care* about the quality of what I write, because deep down I do. I think it would be more beneficial for the reader and my sanity if i let that go. In general, I dislike my writing; I feel I have no unique voice or writing style, and also struggle with voicing what I'm trying to say in the way that I actually want to say it. For me, I want this collection to be the act of thinking and of making my thoughts tangible. They're far too loud and confusing and half baked when they're in my dome. 

Referring back to the question, I want to write to shout, "I was here! I thought things!! I was on this planet at one point. I laughed, I thought, bled, and stumbled through this life. I was here!!" 

The simple hope, I guess, is that my kids—or anyone else—will read these words someday and get a glimpse of the person I was, how I saw the world, or perhaps even learn or see something that stands out to them. In that sense, writing feels like an act of immortality.

#### What am I hoping to discover or understand through this process?

For one, I hope to develop insights into my life - to take a magnifying glass to the things I care about, the ideas that I often think about internally, and in the process of writing hopefully have some sort of "aha moments." And if that does not happen, two, I hope to write out things that are hard to balance in head. Like if someone were to ask me "what are your thoughts on death?... or identity?... or ethics?" or any number of other topics that are not easy to put into words, I don't think I would have a clear or well worded answer in the moment. This process could help me better develop what I believe in and also show how that inevitably changes over time. And third, I want to just enjoy the process of this. I want to feel like a kid again (see image of little me) and not care about the endless pressures of being an "adult." It's been fun to develop this website starting from shitty html pages to slightly less shitty but still shitty html pages. And even just writing this entry so far has been an enjoyable experience. There is more of course, but I think I covered the jist. 

#### What role do I want this website to play? Is it a personal journey, a public project, or both?

I wrote this question with the two "pathways" embedded in the question. The first being a personal journey. This, I think will be the most beneficial to me and should probably be the main goal. I intend to use this in tandem with my physical paper journal (which I believe is crucial for people to have), and I can already see it being a sort of step up from my daily paper journaling. A middle ground between raw unpolished thoughts and thoroughly written pieces. I think it could be a public project at some point...

#### What do I call this?

This has led me to the question of what I call this whole concept of what I'm doing. I think the obvious place to start is a blog-but the term feels too structured and too polished. I feel like blogs are often curated and written with an audience in mind, which I already established I'm not trying to do because then it feels like I am putting on a front. If I'm "blogging" (even if likely no one will actually read the blog), it is the prospect of it that I would subconsiously communicate differently. I think it would end up not being the raw personal journey that I want it to be, but a sort of fabricated and idealized version of myself writing. I already wear that mask enough in my day-to-day life.

Maybe it's a journal, but that would imply a certain privacy that this space doesn't fully have if it is public.

It's more like a log-a personal record like what a general or captain has. I'm not rowing across the Hudson or swashbuckling and raiding coastal villages, but as a man I believe that the path I carve should be documented . In a different direction, maybe it's a collection. This word feels broader, and a little more forgiving. A collection could just be a gathering of thoughts, observations, and moments—some significant, some fleeting or mundane. That might be what I want this to be: a space for anything that feels worth keeping, even if I don’t know why yet. Of course, the correct term or idea may come as I write more.

#### This won't go in the met

And even though the whole process has been messy so far. (hell reading what I wrote I already want to restart), I am going to accept it is more about the process of doing than the result in the end. It's like trying to write a masterpiece in __sidewalk chalk.__ I could erase it, sure, but why would I get out the hose? I just scratched different colored sticks all over the metaphorical concrete and enjoyed the process of doing so. It’s a mark of something that happened, and it matters for now to me at least.
